# Applying Networks to Humanities

## Course Repository

Repository for notebooks and course materials for Autumn course, 'Applying Network Analysis to Humanities'.

You should be accessing this through [CSC notebooks](https://notebooks.rahtiapp.fi/welcome). You need a Haka user account. If you don't have one yet, follow the instructions here: <https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/>

Interactive notebooks (where used) are available for each week, in the folder named notebooks. The notebook starting 1-1 is for week one, class one, 1-2 is week one, class two, 2-1 is week two, class one, and so forth.

To submit the notebook for each class, complete the exercises, making changes to the code where necessary. When finished, 'knit' the document. Because you only have read-only access to the folder storing the notebook, it will ask you to change the location. Save it in your 'my-work' folder, adding your name to the end of the filename. 

Slides for each week are also available, using the same naming conventions.
