## Getting TweetSets data and Hydrating it

There is no coding exercise for this week, but you can use this notebook template to report 
how getting data from TweetSets and hydrating it went.

## Report

A very short summary will do. What is the dataset that you chose from TweetSets, how did you filter it? Did you also manage to
hydrate the tweets? Replace this text block of instructions with your report.
