## Exercises - Visualising your data with ggraph.

Using the `letter_data` dataset, create a network object. Count the number of letters between each pair as a weight:

```{r}

```


Draw a basic points and lines diagram of your network:

```{r}

```

Calculate the degree of the nodes, and add this as a size aesthetic to your network diagram:

```{r}

```


Add a `width` aesthetic to the edges, representing the weight:

```{r}

```
