## Exercises - Visualising your data with ggraph.

Using the `letter_data` dataset, create a network object. Count the number of letters between each pair as a weight:

```{r}

```


Draw a basic points and lines diagram of your network:

```{r}

```

Calculate the degree of the nodes, and add this as a size aesthetic to your network diagram:

```{r}

```

Add arrows and a dashed line to the edges:

```{r}

```

Add a `width` aesthetic to the edges, representing the weight:

```{r}

```

Create a new network, using this larger network dataset. Make it as 'readable' as possible. Use color and size to communicate the relevant information about its structure. Add node labels, but make sensible use of filtering to make it as readable as possible.
