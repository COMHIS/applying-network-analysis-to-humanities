## Degree

-   Counts the number of connections to a particular node
-   Can be directed and weighted

## Betweenness centrality

-   First an algorithm calculates all the 'shortest paths' from every pair of nodes.
-   A node scores highly for betweenness centrality if it is used on many of these paths

## Eigenvector centrality  

-   Measures importance through a node’s connection to other important nodes
-   Similar to the ‘PageRank’ system used by Google to rank search results by importance.
