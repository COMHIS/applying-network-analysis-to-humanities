## Today's lecture

-   Key network metrics (degree, betweenness, density.. )
    -   Node-level

    -   Global
-   Key network concepts (degree distribution, clustering, triadic closure.. )
-   Introduction to Social Network Analysis (more specific application of network analysis).

::: notes
Speaker notes go here.

-   This lesson will cover a number of concepts

-   First, it outlines the concept and theory behind a number of key network metrics.

-   These are generally divided into node-level and global metrics.

-   Second, we'll talk briefly about some theories specific to *social network analysis* (or SNA). Social networks (that is, networks of people, where the connections and structure is governed by social factors) have their own set of concepts, which do not apply to all networks. We won't go into detail (that could be a whole other course), but it's useful to understand.

::: notes
-   Many node-level metrics are interested in *centrality*, that is, working out the most important and most influential nodes in a network.

-   In a social network, this may point to individuals with a particular influence or role in the network, but it can also have other uses: Google's PageRank algorithm uses a version of centrality to work out which web pages are likely of the highest quality or usefulness for a particular search, for example.

# Node-level metrics

## Degree

-   Count of a node's connections.
-   The most basic measurement of *importance* in a network (otherwise known as *centrality.*)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'D')) %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = 'all')) %>% 
  ggraph('stress')  + 
  geom_edge_link()+ 
  geom_node_point(size = 15, pch = 21, fill = 'white') +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = degree)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))

```

## Can be 'directed'

```{r}

tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'A')) %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(indegree = centrality_degree(mode = 'in')) %>% 
  mutate(outdegree = centrality_degree(mode = 'out')) %>% 
  mutate(inout = paste0(indegree, " | ", outdegree)) %>%
  ggraph('stress')  + 
  geom_edge_arc(strength = .1,arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm')), 
                   end_cap = circle(10, 'mm'))+ 
  geom_node_point(size = 15, pch = 21, fill = 'white') +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = inout)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))

```

## Or 'weighted'

-   Weights can be any number of things, depending on the network:
    -   Number of letters sent, strength of friendship, linguistic similarity, etc., etc.

```{r}
tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'D')) %>% mutate(weight = c(1,4,1,1)) %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = 'all')) %>% 
  ggraph('stress')  + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight))+ 
  geom_node_point(size = 15, pch = 21, fill = 'white') +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = degree)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))
```

## Or both...

```{r}
tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'A')) %>% mutate(weight = c(1,4,1,2,1)) %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(indegree = centrality_degree(mode = 'in', weights = weight)) %>% 
  mutate(outdegree = centrality_degree(mode = 'out', weights = weight)) %>% 
  mutate(inout = paste0(indegree, " | ", outdegree)) %>%
  ggraph('stress')  + 
  geom_edge_arc(strength = .1,arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm')), 
                   end_cap = circle(10, 'mm'), aes(width = weight))+ 
  geom_node_point(size = 15, pch = 21, fill = 'white') +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = inout)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))
```

::: notes
-   The degree of a node is a count of its connections.

-   Degree can be weighted and directed.

-   In a directed network, the separate degree counts are called in-degree and out-degree.

-   The total degree is the sum of the two.

-   In this graph, the ego is connected to each alter by an incoming and outgoing link.

-   Weights can be added to the links: degree is a sum of the weights of the links, in that case.

-   The edge weights are labelled in the diagram below, and the numbers inside each node give the in and out degree measurements.
:::

## What does degree mean?

::: notes
-   Depending on the network, these in and out-degree measurements may signify different types of nodes.
:::

-   In a network of Twitter accounts: each follower is counted as an *incoming* link, and each person you follow is counted as an *outgoing* link.

-   **High *in-degree*,** you might have a high influence in this network, because you can broadcast ideas or whatever to a large number of followers.

-   Only **high *out-degree*** in this network may not make you very influential at all, because it means you **follow many accounts** but **few follow you back**.

::: notes
-   Degree is the most common measurement of network *centrality,* or importance.

-   A node with a high degree is likely to have more influence in the network, to have more paths pass through it, and so forth..

-   However, it doesn't always point to the most 'important' nodes.

-   First, degree measures *quantity* over *quality* of links.

-   The node with the highest absolute number of links will always be ranked highest, no matter which nodes those links point to.
:::

## Betweenness Centrality

-   A node has a high **betweenness centrality** if it is used as a step along many of the shortest paths in a network.

::: notes
Betweenness centrality measures all the paths between every pair of nodes in a network.

In the below diagram, A has a higher betweenness centrality than B, because it is needed to traverse from the left to the right side of the network.

-   As mentioned above, degree is not always the best way to measure the importance of a node.

-   It can also be important to consider the node's particular position, and the role it occupies within a larger system.
:::

![](images/betweenness.png)

## Betweenness centrality

-   Betweenness centrality for a given node *v* is calculated by measuring the shortest path between every pair of nodes, and then counting the total number of these paths which pass through *v.*

-   It can be **directed**, meaning that paths are only considered if they exist in the correct direction.

::: notes
-   In the previous diagram, node A is the only way through which any of the nodes on the left can reach any on the right.

-   In a social network, nodes with high betweenness are often thought of as important 'brokers', as we talked about in a previous lesson.

-   However in practice, note that high degree nodes are often the ones which have the highest betweenness values too

## Eigenvector centrality

-   **A** and **B** have two incoming connections each, but **A** has a higher eigenvector centrality score because it is connected to more well-connected nodes.

::: notes
-   A node that has a high eigenvector score is one that is adjacent to nodes that are themselves high scorers.

-   Google's original **PageRank** algorithm used a version of this concept: ranking web pages higher in search results if they themselves were linked to by other high-scoring pages.

-   In the example network here, both A and B have two incoming connections each, but A has a higher eigenvector centrality score because it is connected to more well-connected nodes.

## Closeness centrality

::: notes
-   Closeness centrality measures each node's path to every other node in the network: a node is declared more central if its paths to other nodes tend to be short by this measurement (the formula is 1 divided by the average of all the shortest paths from a given node to all other nodes).

-   Closeness centrality might be thought of as a way of measuring how quickly something flowing through the network will arrive.

-   In the diagram below, A has a higher closeness centrality than B, even though both have the same number of connections, because A is 'less far' to all other nodes, on average.
:::

# Global Metrics

## Density {.smaller}

-   The density of a network is defined as the fraction of edges which are present out of the total possible number of connections.
-   **(a)** has four edges. Full graph **(b)** has six.
-   Density = 4/6 (.6666...)

::: notes
-   Consider the undirected network below (a), which has four edges in total.

-   The 'full graph' (when every node is connected to every other) of an undirected network with four nodes has six edges (b).

-   The density of (a) therefore is 4/6, or .6666...

-   In practice, most real-world networks are much less dense.
:::

![](images/density.png)

::: notes
What implication does this have on the 'small world' networks we talked about in an earlier class?

The 'small world' effect works in low-density networks precisely because of the existence of hubs and weak ties. If there are very few ties in a network altogether, but there are a number of very well-connected hubs, then most nodes will be able to reach any other node by going through these hubs.
:::

## Density {.smaller}

-   In a directed network, the possible number of nodes in the full graph is doubled.
-   **(a)** has 5 edges, total in full graph **(b)** is 12
-   Density is 5/12: 0.4166667..

```{r}
library(patchwork)
p1 = tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'A')) %>%

  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))

p1 + p2

```

::: notes
-   On its own, density may not tell us much about the structure of a graph.

-   Two graphs with 20 edges and 10 nodes may look very different: in one, each node may have two connections, and in another, 9 nodes may have one connection each, and the final one 10 connections.

-   However, in combination with some other metrics, most importantly degree distribution, it may be a clue as to the underlying structure of the network.

What can you tell us about the differences between the degree scores of these two networks?
:::

## Degree distribution

-   Distribution is a statistical term meaning the the distribution of values over a range

-   A 'normal' distribution is one where most values fall around the middle (the mean):

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rtnorm <- function(n, mean=NA, sd=1, lower=-1, upper=1){
  mean = ifelse(is.na(mean)|| mean < lower || mean > upper,
                mean(c(lower, upper)), mean)
  data <- rnorm(n, mean=mean, sd=sd) # data

  if (!is.na(lower) && !is.na(upper)){ # adjust data to specified range
    drange <- range(data)           # data range
    irange <- range(lower, upper)   # input range
    data <- (data - drange[1])/(drange[2] - drange[1]) # normalize data (make it 0 to 1)
    data <- (data * (irange[2] - irange[1]))+irange[1] # adjust to specified range
  }
  return(data)
}

y <- rtnorm(10000, mean = 180, lower = 150, upper = 210)

y %>% as_tibble() %>% ggplot() +  geom_histogram(aes(value), binwidth = 1, color = 'black') + theme_bw()

```

## Degree distribution

```{r}
p3 = g1 %>% as_tibble() %>% ggplot() +  geom_histogram(aes(degree), binwidth = 1) + theme_bw()

p4 = g2 %>% as_tibble() %>% ggplot() +  geom_histogram(aes(degree), binwidth = 1)+ theme_bw()

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 2, heights = c(.6, .4))
```

::: notes
Degree is used to measure structural properties of the network.

We can do this using the **degree distribution**.

A distribution counts how many nodes have a degree of 1, a degree of two, three, and so forth, or sometimes a range, such as a degree of between 1 and 5, 6 and 10, and so on.

This degree distribution tells us some valuable structural properties about the network, such as the extent to which it is a collection of hubs and less important nodes (known as 'scale-free').

-   To illustrate the degree distribution, below is a histogram of the degree distribution for a randomly-created scale-free network with 1000 nodes and 1000 edges.

-   It shows that 0 to 10 nodes have a degree score of 50, 11 - 20 have a degree score of 4, and at the other end, more than 400 nodes have a degree score of just 1.

  as_tbl_graph()%>% mutate(degree =centrality_degree()) %>% as_tibble()


g %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(degree), color = 'black') + theme_bw()

## Log-Log Plot and Degree distribution

::: notes
Another way to illustrate this is with a log-log plot. A log-log plot shows the same data, except the scales are logarithmic, making them easier to read.
:::

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

g %>% 
  count(degree) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(degree, n)) + 
  labs(x = 'Number of nodes', y = 'Degree score') + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()

```

## Scale-free networks

-   Also known as 'scale-free': a number of important hubs with high degree, with lots of less-important nodes.

-   These network types are very common in all sorts of real-world situations, from biological, to social, to computer networks.

-   They've also been shown to have a number of particular properties: for example, it may make a computer network resistant to random 'attack', because its only when hubs are removed that the network begins to become disconnected.

::: notes
-   Removing unimportant nodes doesn't affect the overall system. At the same time, this can make them vulnerable, if hub nodes are specifically targeted.
:::

## Clustering coefficient

-   Extent to which a network is 'clustered' into smaller groups.
-   Measured by counting the number of complete triangles.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)

a= tibble(from= c('A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'E','E', 'E', 'B', 'B', 'B'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K')) %>% as_tbl_graph() 

b = tibble(from= c('A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'E','E', 'E', 'B', 'C', 'F'), to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'C', 'D', 'G')) %>% as_tbl_graph() 

n1 = a %>% ggraph('stress') + 
  geom_node_point(size = 10) + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  theme_void()+ 
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))



n2 = b%>% ggraph('stress') + 
  geom_node_point(size = 10) + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA))+ 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))+ 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.1, .1))

n1 + n2

```

::: notes
-   The clustering coefficient is also known as transitivity, and it is defined as the ratio of completed triangles and connected triples in the graph.

-   The more completed triangles a network contains compared to the overall triples, the more clustered it is said to be.
:::

## Clustering and Social Network Analysis

-   Local transitivity means the probability node B will be connected to node C, *if both nodes are connected to a common neighbour, A.*
-   If you are more likely to connect to your common neighbours, it follows that it is more likely that the graph will be divided into dense cliques and sub-groups, rather than a free-for-all where everyone is connected to everyone else.

# Groups and Community Structure in Networks

## Components

-   The simplest 'group' in a network is a 'component': a subset of nodes which are all connected to each other through some path.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

g <- sample_islands(5, 20, 2/10, 0)

g %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  mutate(component = as.character(group_components())) %>% 
  ggraph('fr') + geom_edge_link(alpha = .7) + geom_node_point(size = 4, aes(color = component)) + theme_void() + theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

```

## Cliques

A clique is a subset of nodes in a network which are fully connected:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

g <- sample_islands(3, 5, 10/10, 1)

g %>% as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  ggraph('stress') + geom_edge_link(alpha = .3) + geom_node_point(size = 5) + theme_void() + theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

```

## Communities

-   Discovering discrete communities---often called sub-graphs---within a wider network has long been one of the fundamental applications of network science.

-   In epidemiological networks, for example, the extent to which a network tends to break into sub-graphs and the constitution of those parts has important implications for understanding the spread of disease through a system.

-   However if the graph is connected (i.e. if all nodes can reach all other nodes eventually), then the boundaries of any detected community that goes beyond a simple ego network are necessarily arbitrary.

::: notes
-   In a network sense, a community might be generally defined as a sub-grouping within a network which is in some way more densely connected to its internal group members than to those outside the group.

-   The problem, of course, is that if the graph is connected (i.e. if all nodes can reach all other nodes eventually), then the boundaries of any detected community that goes beyond a simple ego network are necessarily arbitrary, flexible, and subjective.

-   It is true that many individuals will sit firmly in the core of a given cluster, but there will be those on the margins who might be considered as members of more than one community---or none.
:::

## Communities {.smaller}

-   In spite of these problems, this rigid way of thinking about communities can serve as a useful tool, to which we can bring our existing knowledge of historical communities and compare them to an algorithm's results.

-   By forcing us to over-simplify, they may not be able to capture the full extent of multiple overlapping communities of identity, but they do help us to reflect on how we think of individuals operating within communities of correspondence.

-   For example, though we might think of person X primarily as a member of group Y, if we look just at their patterns of correspondence, they seem more firmly in group Z.

-   This is not to say that we should necessarily re-evaluate the scholarship and declare that they were in group Z all along, but it might be an indication that we should re-assess that person's patterns of correspondence---after all, belonging to a community and being more likely to correspond with its members are not the same thing. 

## Community Detection Methods

-   Network science has a large of algorithms for finding optimal communities in graphs. Many rely on a metric called modularity

## Modularity

-   Modularity is a score evaluating how well a given set of group labels describe the groups found in a network.

-   It's calculated as the number of edges falling within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with edges placed at random.

## Modularity

-   Community detection algorithms work by trying to maximise this value.

## Louvain Community Detection {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The Louvain algorithm is one algorithm which uses modularity, developed specifically for use in large graphs.
-   Each node is temporarily moved to the community of each of its neighbours, and the modularity of the whole graph is re-checked.
-   This continues until modularity does not increase any more.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/louvain.png){width="500"}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   At first, each node in the network is assigned to a community of just itself.

-   Then, one at a time, each node is temporarily moved to the community of each of its neighbours, and the modularity of the whole graph is re-checked using the method above.

-   Each node is kept in the community which results in the highest change in overall modularity. 

-   At this point, most nodes are now in a community of two (if there's no change in modularity, they stay in their own community).

-   The next step treats these mini-communities as nodes in a network in their own right, and runs the same process again (putting each mini-community into the mini-community of its neighbour, calculating overall modularity, and moving to that which gives it the highest gain).

-   This whole process then repeats until modularity stops increasing and communities stop merging with other communities---or a pre-supplied threshold is reached.

-   In very large graphs, the process is more difficult and likely to give different results depending on the random starting point.

-   Also, while the method may be a useful way of finding communities without preconceived starting points, it does require us to think of the network as being divided into communities of some kind.

-   Every node must be placed in a community - none can be placed outside the communities, and, perhaps more controversially, with this method, no node can be a member of more than one community.

## Louvain Community Detection

-   Important to note is that communities are to some degree subjective, and 'densely-connected' can have different meanings depending on the algorithm.

-   And needless to say, detecting communities on a graph alone does not make a research question!

# Social network concepts: triadic closure, transitivity, brokerage

## Social Network Analysis

-   Deals with relationships between *people*
-   Generally uses complete (or nearly complete data)

## Triads

-   A triad is simply the name given to any set of three connected nodes in a network.
-   There are a number of different triad combinations, or **types**
-   The proportion of various triad types in a network can tell us about its structure, and, in the case of a complex network, something of the process by which connections are formed.
-   In this way, we connect the *micro* structure (the information on individual pairs or triads) with the *macro* (what this tells us about the overall formation and structure of a network).

## Triads - undirected network {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   In an undirected network, there are four possble triad types, as seen in the diagram below.
-   The first, a **closed triad**, is when each node is connected to the other two.
-   The other possibilities are **open triad**, where one of the three possible connections is not present, a **closed pair**, where just one pair of the three is connected, and a **disconnected triad**.

## Triads - directed networks

::: notes
-   In a directed network, the situation is more complex.

-   Each of the connections can be incoming or outgoing, meaning there are 16 possible triad connections.

-   Don't worry, if you want to use these, network analysis software has methods for taking a 'census' of the various triads and their counts in a particular network.
:::

<center>![The 16 possible triad combinations in a directed network. The code underneath each triad refers to the numbers of mutual, asymmetric, and null dyads, with a further identifying letter: Up, Down, Cyclical, Transitive. E.g., 120D has 1 mutual, 2 asymmetric, 0 null dyads, and the Down orientation.](images/triad_census.jpg)</center>

## Triadic Closure

-   Triadic closure is the simple idea that people in a social network are more likely to connect to each other if they share another common connection.

-   In social network theory, this is very common, and thought to drive the process of network formation. It's called triadic closure, because it measures the relation between triads - sets of three nodes.

-   It's easy to measure in a network: we can do so simply by measuring the number of 'complete' triangles.

## Why is this interesting?

-   As well as helping to explain network formation, we can think about how various triads work on a micro-level.

-   Let's start with a simple example: an undirected friendship network between three people.

-   A and B know each other, as do B and C, but A and C have never met:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.width=2, fig.align='center', fig.cap ="An open triad, meaning one with a missing third connection."}

b =  tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'B'), to = c('B', 'C', 'C') ) %>% 
  graph_from_data_frame(directed = F) %>%
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  activate(edges)  %>% slice(-2) %>% 
  ggraph(layout = layout) + 
  geom_edge_link(width = 2) +  
  geom_node_point(size = 20, fill = 'white', pch = 21, stroke = 2) + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) + 
   theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.2, .2)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.2, .2))
b
```

## The Strength of Weak Ties

![](images/image-asset.jpeg)

::: notes
-   Mark Granovetter's paper ['The Strength of Weak Ties'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392) looked at the formation of these triads their role in a network.

-   For Granovetter, edges in a network are formed of either 'strong' or 'weak' ties.

-   He writes that in an unclosed triad, if the two existing edges are strong ties, a third edge will always eventually appear between the final two nodes, forming a closed triad.

-   An unclosed triad containing two strong edges is impossible and he calls this the 'forbidden triad'.

## Structural Holes

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The sociologist Ronald Burt, in his book *Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition* theorised that these gaps could be beneficial to individuals, and that people with many of these kinds of relationships were often successful in business.

:::
:::

::: notes
-   This gap, from A to C, is sometimes called a 'structural hole'.

-   In this triad, B is particularly important because they are needed for information to be shared between A and C. B may even work to keep A and C from meeting and 'closing' the triad.
:::

## Brokerage

-   Another influential paper, by Gould and Fernandez, used triads in their theory of *brokerage*.

-   This is a process, according them, where individuals act as intermediaries in a network, helping to share information.

-   They identify five types of brokerage roles, based on specific triad types, as seen in the image below:

<center>![The five different brokerage roles, according to Gould and Fernandez (1989). In each case, the ellipses represent different 'sub-groups' of the wider network that each node belongs to.](images/brokerage_custom.jpg)</center>

## A Word of Warning...

![](images/71nlyx.jpg)

::: notes
-   It's easy to see the appeal of these methods applied to historical or cultural sources, which we might use to uncover the specific social relations within a network of historical actors, understand the formation by which a particular correspondence network came about, or maybe measure the 'success' of a particular historical figure by the existence of 'structural holes' in their networks.

-   I encourage you to think about and use these theories.

-   However, do bear in mind that these theories were often developed using modern, 'complete' social network data, where every interaction was carefully recorded, often for the purposes of a particular test.

-   As these methods rely heavily on these 'micro' structures (such as the presence or absence of a particular tie), they may be particularly sensitive to the kinds of missing data often found in historical sources, which are not usually collected systematically.
:::

## Conclusions {.smaller}

-   This tour of network metrics has just introduced some of the more common ways a network can be measured.

-   All of these metrics can be applied to any network, but bear in mind that many have been developed with the specific aim of measuring relations between people in some sort of set of social interactions, and the conclusions drawn are based on the consideration that the individuals are in some sense 'free agents', and can freely connect with other nodes as they wish.

-   In many other network types (books, or cities for example), there may be hidden factors and other constraints guiding the structure of the network.

-   This is not to say that the metrics cannot be used, but just that the conclusions from them may not be the same as those in SNA literature.
