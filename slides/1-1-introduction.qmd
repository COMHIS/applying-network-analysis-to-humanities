## Final Project

-   The final project is due on January 17

-   The final project tasks you with using your network data and related data model to carry out an analysis.

-   The project should take the form of an R Markdown notebook, which you'll learn how to create over the next few weeks.

-   You'll write up this document and then turn it into a HTML page - a process known as 'knitting'.

## Final Project Presentation

-   To help you with your project, we ask you to present your ideas and proposed methods to the rest of the group

-   You'll be allocated a ten-minute presentation slot, for either Wednesday or Friday of the final week.

-   You'll also be asked to give feedback and ask questions of the other class participants, with the aim of helping their own projects.

## Grading {.smaller}

In this course, each of the learning objectives builds on top of the previous one. To receive the highest grade, students should demonstrate competency in the following five areas. The criteria for each grade is given below:

1: Through the final project, show a basic understanding of network principles and metrics, and demonstrate the ability to conduct a descriptive analysis of a network dataset.

2: Additionally, present a conceptual and logical data model representing a particular set of data tables.

3: Demonstrate how this particular data model can be used to construct queries of large datasets.

4: Use the above skills to produce an analysis of a particular humanities questions

5: Additionally, demonstrate a critical eye for these technologies, how they apply to your particular dataset, and what the potential pitfalls are.

# Introduction to Networks

## What do we mean by a 'network'?

-   The word 'network' is ubiquitous in our daily lives.

-   The Oxford English Dictionary tells us the term itself originally was first defined as `Work (esp. manufactured work) in which threads, wires, etc., are crossed or interlaced in the fashion of a net.` (think patch work)

## What do we mean by a 'network'?

-   Now we commonly use it for any complex system of interrelated things:

    -   We all use social networking, and the telephone, railway, and road networks;

    -   An area of a city might be described as having networks of alleyways,

    -   A historian might write about a network of trading posts.

## Networks are Metaphorical?

-   These are all in some way metaphorical.

-   The networks we'll learn about and use on this course have a more specific definition.

-   In mathematics, a network is an object made up of *things* and *connections.*

-   To use the standard language, the *things* are called **nodes** (or sometimes vertices), and the *connections* called **edges**.

## Nodes and Edges

These things (and connections) could be almost anything. Some typical examples include:

-   Nodes are people, and the edges their friendships or followers, as in a typical social network.

-   The nodes are books and authors, and the connection is 'written by'.

-   Nodes are web pages on the internet

-   **In this final example, what might the connections be?**

## Networks in the Humanities

-   Networks have long been used to understand aspects of historical or cultural change.

-   Some typical uses of complex networks in humanities subjects include [spatial networks](https://model-articles.rrchnm.org/articles/midura/), [line of sight](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdigh.2017.00017/full) or [pottery similarity networks](https://academic.oup.com/book/40384/chapter-abstract/347130019?redirectedFrom=fulltext) in archaeology, [historic road networks](https://www.landesgeschichte.uni-goettingen.de/handelsstrassen/index.php), and [character networks in plays](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/network-visualization-shakespeare/).

-   In this course, we'll mostly work with networks as tools for **descriptive** and **exploratory** data analysis.

-   But network science also has wide uses in **statistical and predictive modelling**.

# Some Examples

Before we get in to some of the details, it's worth going through a few examples of interesting projects which have combined humanities data with network science.

## Ruth and Sebastian Ahnert, Tudor networks {.smaller}

Speaker notes (press 's' when presenting to switch to speaker mode).

As found in your reading this week, Ahnert and Ahnert used a number of network measurements to make a 'network fingerprint' for individuals in an archive of Tudor state papers. Using this measure, they were able to identify or confirm spies and collaborators. Specifically, they looked at individuals with a high betweenness (a bridging measurement) in comparison to their degree (measuring their overall connections): represented by the points underneath the trendline in the graph below. The biggest outlier is Jon Snowden: an alias of John Cecil, a Catholic priest in exile in Elizabeth I's regime. Looking at others with a similar profile revealed other conspirators.

In below video, accompanying a [paper in *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1240064), researchers graphed places of birth and death---taken from Wikidata---as nodes and edges, using it as a way to trace the movement of culture from one area of the world to another, and how this changed over time.

Given that the information is taken from Wikidata, what problems could you envisage with this study?

While Wikidata is a large data source, it is obviously very partial and has a particular focus, for example in favour of white, male, Western Europeans. The study may just replicate the biases of Wikidata itself, hiding the important cultural influences on the west, from other parts of the world.

::: notes
In [this project](https://jhnr.uni.lu/index.php/jhnr/article/view/7), Ingeborg van Vugt made a 'multi-layer network' by combining a network of letters with a network of book mentions. The paper compared the networks of the Dutch philologist, Nicolaas Heinsius, and the Florentine librarian Antonio Magliabechi. Dynamic visualisations were made using the Nodegoat software. One key finding was that having access to books turned these people into experts - scholars would send their books to them, and then in turn they would use this information to inform their correspondents. Van Vugt showed that these two separate spheres (books and correspondence) were related to each other, that a book dedication could influence whether two individuals would write to each other, and so forth.

## Six Degrees of Francis Bacon

![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2011.26.54.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

::: notes
The [Six Degrees of Francis Bacon](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) project used co-occurrence networks (a technique we'll learn about later) to infer links between early modern individuals. Specifically, they looked for co-occurrences of individuals in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, inferring links if two individuals were mentioned together more than was statistically significant. This data was then turned into an interactive social network.

Rather than answering a specific question, the Six Degrees project is a good example of how we can use networks as exploratory tools. The interactive site can be used to explore patterns and groups who were likely connected, and can be used as a starting-point to understanding the social relations of a figure of interest.

## Mapping the digital humanities community of Twitter

![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-03%20at%2011.46.29.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Network analysis has naturally been used extensively to understand the structure of social networks and sites like Reddit. In [this study](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01517493), the authors measured the centrality of a group of 2,500 Twitter users self-identified as digital humanities practioners. They found that there were separate communities of languages, and that French was particularly isolated.

## Graph Theory

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Representing data as nodes and edges allows us to use the mathematics of *graph theory* to analyse and explore it.

-   The origins of graph theory date back to the 18th century, and the mathematician Leonard Euler.

## Graph Theory

-   The city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) was built on a river with two islands and a system (a network, perhaps?) of seven bridges connecting them.

![](images/Image-Koenigsberg,_Map_by_Merian-Erben_1652.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Graph Theory

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   The inhabitants of the city had long wondered if there it was possible to devise a route which would cross each bridge exactly once.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/euler_bubble.jpg)
:::
:::

## Graph Theory

-   Euler solved this problem by abstracting the bridge system into what we now call a graph: a structure with nodes and edges.

![](images/Screenshot%202022-09-26%20at%2011.25.49.png){fig-align="center"}

## Graph Theory

-   He used this approach to prove that the path was only possible if the graph had exactly zero or two nodes with a *degree* (a count of the total connections) with an odd number.

-   This process: abstracting a system to its connections, and devising mathematical rules to understand it, forms the basis of modern graph theory.

## Graph Theory

-   Graph theory has methods to perform all sorts of calculations on the network: both on the individual nodes (for example to find the most important nodes by various measurements), and on the network as a whole.

-   Rather than think about each individual relationship separately, a network model means that we can understand some more about how each part is interrelated, how the structure itself is important, and how one node might affect another in complex ways.

## Why use networks in humanities?

-   Network analysis has become one of the most popular (and perhaps one of the most overused) techniques in the digital humanities toolbox. Over this course, we'll ask you to think critically about the methods you use and when they might not always be the best way to think about your data.

-   There are plenty of circumstances when a network model is not the best was of representing a dataset, as we'll learn. However, representing data as a network has a number of unique benefits:

## Some Benefits of a Network Approach:

-   Networks allow us to reduce or understand **complexity:** we can reduce complicated data to its overall structure. Network visualisations, when used well, allow us to **spot patterns** and make inferences on the structure of our data.

-   Rather than consider each individual data point as isolated, networks allow us to consider how **data is interrelated**, and how the relationships between nodes effect each other and the overall structure.

## Some Benefits of a Network Approach:

-   Network techniques allow us to move **beyond pairs** to putting entities and their relationships in a much larger context, showing how they bridge the local and the global. They allow us to consider **groups** within data, particularly in communication networks.

-   Networks can point to data subsets worth investigating in more detail: allowing us to move from **close to distant reading**, and in-between.

# Network Basics

This section introduces the fundamental ideas behind network analysis, including its key components, and various network types.

## Nodes and Edges

As already mentioned, a network is a graph consisting of nodes and edges (connections). Typically (though not always), the edges are *pairwise,* meaning they run between a pair of nodes. These are often represented visually as points (the nodes) and lines (the edges), like this:

![](images/Screenshot%202022-09-26%20at%2011.42.32.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

## Edge weights

-   These connections can often have a *weight* attached, for example the number of letters exchanged between two people, or the number of times two actors appear in a scene in a movie or play together.

![](images/Screenshot%202022-09-26%20at%2011.42.58.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

## Edge weights

-   A weight might also be a measurement of similarity or difference between two nodes, such as a linguistic similarity between two books (a network can also be between inanimate objects!), or the distance between two cities on a map. These weights can be used in the calculations.

## Edge direction

-   Edges can also have *directions,* meaning that the incoming and outgoing links are counted separately: for example we might count incoming and outgoing letters separately.

-   Another typical illustration of **directed** and **undirected** networks is the difference between Twitter and Facebook:

    -   Facebook friends must be reciprocated - both people have to accept the friend request, meaning that a Facebook network is undirected.

    -   Twitter, on the other hand, is a directed network, because an individual can have separate *follower* and *following* numbers.

::: {notes}
What might this letter count tell us about a relationship in a network? What potential danger is there is reading something from this?

It might be worth considering how the letter network was constructed. Often they are reconstructed from personal letter archives, which tend to be collections of mostly incoming letters to a single person or family. In that case, it's likely the difference between incoming and outgoing letters is not statistically significant, but simpy a product of the method of data collection.
:::

## Weighted and directed

-   These directed edges can also have separate weights attached to them:

![](images/Screenshot%202022-09-26%20at%2011.31.15.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

## Network paths

-   One of the central concepts behind networks is that they allow information to travel along the edges, moving from node to node.

-   In a metaphorical sense, nodes with less 'hops' between them have an easier route to this information, and may be said to be close together or influential on each other.

-   If we add more than three nodes to the network, these paths begin to emerge.

-   A network path is simply a route, travelling along edges, from one node to another in a network.

## Network paths

-   Some network metrics use these paths to estimate structural importance, for example.

-   Paths work differently in *directed* networks: information can only move in the direction of the edges.

# Different Network Types

## Bipartite networks

-   In the above examples, the nodes and connections have been very straightforward: two things of the same *type* (people in a social network for example) connected to each other.

-   These are known as *one-mode* or *unipartite* networks.

-   However, many networks you'll encounter will be of things of different types.

-   These are known as *bipartite networks,* and we'll return to them later in the course. They are very common in humanities data.

## Bipartite Network Examples

-   Some examples include:

    -   A network of characters in a play connected to scenes they appear in.

    -   A network of company directors connected to companies

    -   A network of publishers connected to the books they financed.

    -   A network of people connected to membership of certain organisations

## Bipartite Networks

-   Below, each individual is listed as the publisher of a number of books

-   A publisher can be connected to many books, but the two types of nodes cannot be connected to each other

![](images/bipartite.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Bipartite Projections

-   Many network measurements and algorithms are designed to be used on regular, *one-mode* networks.

-   Often, when working with bipartite networks, we *collapse* the network into one of the node types, meaning that we directly connect one of the types to each other, based on shared connections to the other type.

## Bipartite Projections

-   In the figure on the left below, we have collapsed the network so that now, publishers are directly connected to each other, based on shared appearances on books.

-   If publishers shared multiple books, this can be added to the new edge as weight.

![](images/bipartite.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
What would a projected network of the other type (books connected to books) look like?

All three books would be connected to each other, because they all have one publisher in common (Strahan). Book 1 and book 3 would have an edge weight of 2, because they have two publishers in common (Millar and Strahan).
:::

## Multigraphs {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   There can also be multiple *kinds* of edges, in the same network.

-   For example in a network of historical correspondents, you might have 'met in person' as well as 'sent a letter to/from'.

-   If these edges are not merged, these graphs are known as **multigraphs**.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidygraph)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(tidyverse)

tibble(from = c('A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B'),
       to = c('B', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'C'), 
       type = c('met', 'met', 'met', 'letter', 'letter')) %>% 
  graph_from_data_frame() %>% 
  ggraph() + 
  geom_edge_fan(width = 1,aes(label = type), 
                   angle_calc = 'along',
                   label_dodge = unit(2.5, 'mm'),
                   arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm')), 
                   end_cap = circle(10, 'mm')) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 20, pch = 21, fill = 'white', stroke = 2) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(.2,.2)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.2,.2))
```

:::

## Hypergraphs

-   In an ordinary network, an edge always connects two nodes together.

-   A network where each edge can connect to any number of nodes is called a **hypergraph**.

## Hypergraphs

-   Below, an edge is no longer a line but a coloured area, and each of the points which fall within them are connected nodes.

![](images/1920px-Hypergraph-wikipedia.svg.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Hypergraphs

-   Good real-world examples are WhatsApp or Facebook groups: each person can be a member of multiple groups.

-   These networks---multigraphs and hypergraphs---require an additional set of algorithms, and generally off-the-shelf tools have not been developed for them in the same way as exist for normal graphs.

-   However, there are packages available for R which have been developed to deal with them.

::: notes
What other way could we model the network of Facebook or WhatsApp groups?

These could also be considered bipartite networks (individuals connected to groups).
:::

## Spatial networks

-   A final type of network is a spatial network: one where the nodes and edges have real-world spatial characteristics.

-   A good example of this is a road network: edges can be represented as geometric lines, and cities and other points of interest as geographic points.

## Spatial networks

-   These can have historical uses, for example the early modern road network of some of north-western Europe has been mapped by the Viabundus project as a spatial network.

-   Using simple network shortest-path algorithms and adding the road length as a weight, the data can be used to plot likely itineraries from one point to another.

## Spatial networks

![A map of the early modern road network made with data from the Viabundus project. Each color represents the 'neighbourhood' of roads which can be reached from Urecht in a single day.](images/viabundus.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## From Bridges to Social Networks...

-   In the twentieth century, this graph theory began to be used by sociologists to understand the processes behind business, family, and friendship ties.

-   Gave birth to the field of 'social network analysis'

-   Human nodes naturally behave quite differently to an island, after all.

::: notes
In what specific way might the connection between two people have different attributes to a connection between two islands?

Bridges and islands, clearly, don't have any choices as to whom they will connect to: it is determined by their geographic position. So many network analysis techniques may not be appropriate. But it is a good example of how graph theory should be considered firstly as a set of mathematical tools.

-   In a [1973 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392), Mark Granovetter argued that the most important ties in a network are often those which connect two separate social groups together.

-   These ties, according to Granovatter, occupy a 'brokerage' position, and can be key in certain situations.

-   Job seekers are more likely to find the most useful leads through their distant acquaintances rather than their close friends...

-   This 'brokerage' position can be deduced mathematically using a metric known as *betweenness centrality* (we'll come back to that in a later class).

::: {notes}
Why might this be the case?

It's because, according to Granovetter, these distant acquaintances are more likely to be able to provide 'new' information on opportunities: a close friend, on the other hand, will probably have access to the same information as you.

-   In 1967, series of postcards were mailed out to random people in US cities.

-   Participants were asked to send the postcard to a target person, or the person they thought might know them

What problems can you imagine with this experiment?

It's worth considering how the experiment may be biased. Are all groups of people equally likely to answer (or have the time and money to carry out) a request from a random postcard? How might this have distorted the findings?

-   The average number of hops was between five and a half and six.

-   This information was later used to claim that everyone in the US was connected by 'six degrees of separation'.

## The 'New' Science of Networks

-   The most common use of networks in academic research much of the 20th century was looking at these small, sociological networks of relationships between people.

-   This changed in the late 1990s, beginning of network research to understand the structures governing many kinds of complex systems, e.g the structure of the World Wide Web.

-   This research showed that many of these complex networks had a similar structure: a small number of nodes with a very large number of connections, known as *hubs,* and a large number of nodes with very few connections.

-   The structure followed what is known as a *power-law*: many nodes have a very small number of connections, an exponentially smaller number of nodes have an exponentially larger number of connections, and so forth..

## Scale-free Networks and Preferential Attachment

-   Process was guided by *preferential attachment*, meaning the structure of the network is explained by the fact that nodes attach themselves to nodes which already had many connections, leading to a 'rich get richer' effect.

-   Demonstrated empirically that structure could be found across a range of networks, from computers, to people, to biological networks or neurons in the brain.

-   A scale-free network means it is easy for a disease to spread, because once it reaches a hub node it can easily move throughout the network.

## What do networks really tell us?

-   Do they tell us something interesting, such as why a group of contacts formed in a particular formed in this way?

-   Do they just reflect the data that we have collected or have available?

-   What does a complex 'hairball' network diagram really tell us?

-   Have the claims of *Linked* really helped us to understand business, economics, and the spread of disease?

## Last thoughts...

-   Between now and the next class, try to consider the ways some of the data you have used in your studies might be thought of as a network, and what benefits (and pitfalls) that approach might bring.

-   Lastly, remember that a network is a *model:* a set of proposals to explain something about the real world. It is an artificial construction, or a metaphor, rather than the thing itself. As such, even a very 'accurate' network is likely to be only one of many such models which could be used as an explanation for a particular phenomenon or observation. Throughout this course, you should use your critical tools to keep this in mind, and assess the usefulness of a particular model to your data explorations.
