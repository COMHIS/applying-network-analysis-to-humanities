## Basic Info on course

X weeks

## CSC Notebooks  

- How to log on, demo what to do (but explain we'll do this during practical parts)

## Networks are everywhere.. but what are they?

-   We live in a 'networked world'
-   The word 'network' is ubiquitous:
-   Communication networks
-   Transport networks
-   Social networks
-   Has a formal meaning in mathematics, social and physical sciences: a representation of the relations between entities

## Goals of this lecture

-   The lecture will be a brief overview of the origins and concept of network analysis as it applies to humanities subjects.
-   By the end you should:
    -   Have a basic knowledge of network analysis and its key concepts
    -   Understand key terminology such as nodes and edges
    -   Understand some important network measurements and how to interpret them
    -   Have a practical starting-point for the tools and methods needed to turn your own research into network data

## Leonard Euler, graph theory, and the 'Königsberg Bridge Problem'

-   Network analysis has its origins in 'graph theory', put forward by the 18th century mathematician Leonhard Euler.
-   Trying to solve the 'Königsberg Bridge problem'

## From Graphs to Networks...

-   Graphs can be used to represent 'things' (called nodes) and connections between them (called links or edges).
-   Often represented as a 'network diagram, where the nodes are points and the edges lines.
-   They have a few additional properties: they can be directed and weighted

## Directed Networks

-   Directed networks are ones in which the information flows in a particular direction, from one node to another.

## Weighted Networks

-   A weighted network is one where these is a measurement representing the strength of the ties between the nodes.

## Social Network Analysis

-   Graph theory applied to systems of relations between people
-   Eg. Mark Granovetter, 'Strength of Weak ties' (1973)
-   Do we learn more from our distant acquaintances than our close friends?

## The 'New Science of Networks'

-   Using network theory to understand and map very large complex systems such as the internet
-   Papers by Barabasi (1999) and Watts & Strogatz (1998) shows that many real-world networks have a similar structure
-   A small number of nodes with many connections, often called 'hubs', and many nodes with very few connections.

## Small world

-   Hubs make it easy to reach other parts of network even with a very few total connections
-   This has been called the 'small-world' phenomenon, and helps to explain why everyone is so well-connected to everyone else!
-   These types of networks are also resistant to failure but susceptible to targeted attack.

## Network Analysis and the Humanities

-   Networks particularly suitable to humanities data, because we are in the business of relations
-   In the past 20 years has been used to analyse historical social networks, archaeology, geographic networks, historical infrastructure, and others
-   Also relevant to many other areas: even literary studies, art history etc.

## Almost anything can be a network..

-   Almost anything can be represented as a network
-   Network of words in a literary text, or characters in a play

## Constructing and Analysing Network Data: practical steps  

-   Networks very commonly constructed from an ‘edge list’: a list of connections between pairs of nodes, often in a simple spreadsheet with two columns
-   Data can be entered manually on a small scale
-   Lots of existing humanities datasets available online, ready for network analysis
-   A huge range of software available to visualise and analyse network data  

## Network Visualisation  

-   Often represented as a force-directed network
-   Highly-connected groups of nodes are placed closely together
-   Useful to get a sense of the overall ‘topology’, or map of a network, findings its centres, peripheries and separate clusters

## Network Analysis Metrics  

-   The metrics above can be used to highlight important nodes
-   Think about the implications of each one for your own data and research
  -   Eg high degree score in historical social network might indicate an important communicator; high degree in an archaeological network something else entirely.  
  
## Pitfalls of Network Analysis  

-   Be careful in interpreting the results - particularly with messy data
-   Some network types (such as bipartite) need additional steps in order to be able to analyse them accurately.
-   Think about whether your network is representing a view of the world, or a view of the data used and its own agenda or history of collection!

## Conclusions  

-   Networks can be a powerful way to quantitatively assess related objects
-   Easy to analyse with a variety tools
-   Both visualisation and network metrics can be useful
-   Think about how your own data might be represented as a network
